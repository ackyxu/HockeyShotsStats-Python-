# Hockey Shots Stats  -Python-

This was the first project that spark my interest in both data analytics and coding.

Detail instruction with how to retrive data from NHL's Stats API can be found here, provided by Drew Haynes:
- https://gitlab.com/dword4/nhlapi/-/blob/master/stats-api.md

I will not upload any calls to the API or database containing the raw stats data in this repository.

I am also current working on converting this project to Java with OOP design principals [here](https://github.com/ackyxu/HockeyShotStats)

###TODO:

A better description of this project!  I has been a while since I touched it!
